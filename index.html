		The application opens up into a map spanning the entire screen. The user will be prompted with the option to: <br><br><b>"Look for tracks near by"<br></b> alternatively, the user can <b>browse the map</b> or type key words into the <b>Search Bar</b>

		<h3>		
		Tracks appear as colored lines, and <b>loop tracks are shaded</b> in to represent a closed path. <br><br>Color represent grade of difficulty, and red means a track is CLOSED. <br><br> When a track is selected it will glow, and a box containing information about the trail will pop up from the bottom of the screen.
